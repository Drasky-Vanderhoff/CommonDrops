# CommonDrops - Work in Progress ( not playable at all )

A free clone of Magical Drop made with just C++ SFML library, mostly for learning purpose and because i love magical drop.

### Objectives for v0.1
- Make the survival mode work in the most basic manner.
- Write unit testing for it and make CrystalMatrix very reliable on its interaction and internal process resolution.

### Future versions
- special crystals than can make everything explotes, crystal throw and grab animations, etc
- Challenge Mode
- Online ??? ( probably not xD )

### TODO
- Add links to the art i'd used for this game. Everything was taken from https://opengameart.org and it uses CC0 license.
